Suppose we are interested in the top options for DGW32, measured by FPL points per 90 mins (pp90) so far this season?

With fplscrapR, we can do that just a few lines of code:

```{r, message=F,warning=F}
library(fplscrapR)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r,warning=F}
df <- get_player_info()

df %>% 
  filter(total_points >= 30) %>% # filtering for players with more than 30 points scored
  filter(team %in% c(3,5,6,7,9,13,14,17,18,20)) %>% # filtering for teams with a DGW in GW32 
  mutate(pp90 = total_points / minutes * 90) %>% # creating the 'pp90' variable
  select(playername,pp90) %>% # selecting player name and pp90 for our table
  arrange(-pp90) %>% # ordering (arranging) by pp90
  slice(1:20) # showing just the top20
```
